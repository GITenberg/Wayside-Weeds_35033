<p class="t">&ldquo;. . . amidst the fairest flowers</p>
<p class="t">Of the blest isles, Elysium&rsquo;s blooming bowers.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<span class="ddcont">Greek inscription on a marble at Rome. Neaves, <i>Greek Anthology</i>,
<i>Edin.</i>, 1874, p. 62 (&ldquo;blooming,&rdquo; vulgarism,
meaning weedy.)</span></dd>
<dd><a id="ffn2" href="#ffr2">2.</a> Cf. <i>Ezekiel</i>, xxxvii. 1, 2.</dd>
<dd><a id="ffn3" href="#ffr3">3.</a> Academic &ldquo;crowns and halos&rdquo; (cf. Seneca, <i>Naturales
Questiones</i>, 1, 2, 1 and 3) must needs, for obvious
reasons, be made of paper. Notice also the subtle
suggestion that Dr. Ellis is <i>laurea donandus
Apollinari</i>, worthy of the laurel (crown) of Apollo.
(Horace, <i>Carminum</i>, iv. 2, 9.)</dd>
<dd><a id="ffn4" href="#ffr4">4.</a> Why should &ldquo;the gown and hood&rdquo; be required &ldquo;for
angels&rsquo; wings&rdquo;? To clothe them withal, of course.
The draping of angels with wings and the attachment
of wings to the structure of the back of the
human figure have presented problems to artists
in all ages. The best solution is undoubtedly to
cover up the wings, and the gown with its hood is
the only appropriate garment. (Cf. Carpenter,
Edward, &ldquo;Angels&rsquo; Wings,&rdquo; . . . London, 1898, pp.
25-40, in which the anatomical and sartorial difficulties
are fully discussed.)</dd>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_x">[x]</dt>
<dd><a id="ffn8" href="#ffr8">8.</a> Principal Hutton and Dr. Ellis present the phenomenon of
<span class="greek" title="homoblast&ecirc;s">ὁµοβλαστής</span>
sprouting (or swearing) together. Cf. Theophrastus, &ldquo;On
the Causes of Plants,&rdquo; v, 5, 4.</dd>
<dd><a id="ffn10" href="#ffr10">10.</a> In other words, Dr. Ellis is at once
<span class="greek" title="polupaipalos">πολῠπαίπᾰλος,</span>
exceeding crafty (<i>i.e.</i> master of many crafts,
including angling). Cf. Homer, <i>Odyssey</i>, 15, 419,
11. and <span class="greek" title="polupath&ecirc;s">πολῠπᾰθής,</span>
subject to many passions. Cf. Plutarch, <i>Moralia</i>, 171.</dd>
<dd><a id="ffn11" href="#ffr11">11-12.</a> A subtle hint of <span class="greek" title="elasi-bronta">ἐλᾰσί-βροντα,</span>
thunder hurling (cf. Pindar, <i>Fragments</i>, 108), or
<span class="greek" title="helliss&ocirc; b&ocirc;mon">ἑλλίσσω βωµόν,</span>
to dance round about it (whatever it may be). Cf.
Callimachus, <i>Del.</i> 321.</dd>
<dd><a id="ffn13" href="#ffr13">13.</a> Clearly referring to &ldquo;<i>praedam calamo tremente ducit</i>,&rdquo;
he draws in his prey with a rod. Martial, 4, 30, 9.
Cf. <i>infra</i>, <a href="#p6">&ldquo;Weed&rdquo; p. 31</a>.</dd>
<dd><a id="ffn16" href="#ffr16">16.</a> &ldquo;The pious Jordan&rdquo; is evidently a bull, referring to
the cult of the river-god. It reflects <i>tauriformis
Aufidus</i>, the bull-formed Aufidus, the river upon
which Horace was born (Horace, <i>Carminum</i>, iv.
14, 25). We also have our Afidus or Jordan,
upon whose banks our own Horace lives.</dd>
<dt class="pb" id="Page_xi">[xi]</dt>
<dd><a id="ffn17" href="#ffr17">17-20.</a> An ingenious reference to the University final
examinations in May, when candidates write all
day and the examiner reads and smokes till dawn.
Having subjected his victims to freshly devised
tortures (<i>novo quaestiones genere distorsit</i>
Suetonius, <i>Dom.</i> 10), he broods over their miseries and their
papers&mdash;<span class="greek" title="eleas aneleos">ἐλεᾶς ἀνέλεος</span>&mdash;an
owl without pity.</dd>
<dd><a id="ffn23" href="#ffr23">23-24.</a> Or, in the language of the angler, his
<span class="greek" title="epanthrakides">ἐπανθρᾰκίδες</span>

<p class="t0">And white were his teeth, when a joyful grin</p>

<p class="t0">His face was daubed with black and with red,</p>
<p class="t0">No trousers he wore, but fringed leggings instead,</p>
<p class="t0">And moccasins &rsquo;broidered with quills for thread.</p>

<p class="t0">Little White Crow had a sharp <i>couteau</i>,</p>

<p class="t0">Father Le Cocq was a priest from Quebec,</p>

<p class="t0">He&rsquo;d a stoop in the shoulder, was yellow of skin,</p>
<p class="t0">With closely cut hair, and a smooth shaven chin,</p>
<p class="t0">He had very black eyes, and a rather red nose;</p>
<p class="t0">Wore shoes with steel buckles and very square toes,</p>
<p class="t0">A big shovel hat, a black cassock and bands,</p>
<p class="t0">And a rosary seldom was out of his hands.</p>

<p class="t0">Viz.:&mdash;&ldquo;Do as you&rsquo;re bid, and don&rsquo;t cry if it hurt you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Though gentle by nature and fond of his ease,</p>
<p class="t0">He would work like a slave his Superior to please;</p>
<p class="t0">He would shrink from no danger, pain, toil or disgrace,</p>
<p class="t0">Or would swear wrong was right until black in the face!</p>
<p class="t0">As wise as a serpent, as firm as a rock,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet as meek as a dove was good Father Le Cocq.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With bell, book and candle the priest had been sent</p>
<p class="t0">To Ottawa&rsquo;s banks, with the pious intent</p>
<p class="t0">To find, if he could, after diligent search,</p>
<p class="t0">A few stray, red sheep for the fold of the church;</p>
<p class="t0">And there in a cabin of poles and of bark,</p>
<p class="t0">He sang hymns and said masses from daylight to dark.</p>
<p class="t0">It happened one day that good Father Le Cocq</p>
<p class="t0">Had been visiting some of the lambs of his flock,</p>
<p class="t0">And homeward returning, his pious task done,</p>
<p class="t0">Was paddling along at the set of the sun.</p>
<p class="t0">Now a man may be virtuous, learned, austere,</p>
<p class="t0">In religion devout, and in morals severe,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p class="t0">Yet,&mdash;true as it&rsquo;s strange, and sad as it&rsquo;s true,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Not</i> able to manage a birch bark canoe!</p>
<p class="t0">So now,&mdash;at the paddle by no means a dab,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">He caught what is vulgarly known as a &ldquo;crab&rdquo;:</p>
<p class="t0">His balance he lost, the canoe was upset,</p>
<p class="t0">And Father Le Cocq tumbled into the wet!</p>
<p class="t0">Poor Father Le Cocq! any chance looker-on</p>
<p class="t0">Would have fancied for certain, his usefulness gone.</p>
<p class="t0">And, indeed, the priest&rsquo;s chance was uncommonly slim,</p>
<p class="t0">The current ran fast, not a stroke could he swim,</p>
<p class="t0">And he thought all was over in this world for him.</p>
<p class="t0">But, thanks to St. Francis, St. Anne, St. Ignatius,</p>
<p class="t0">Or some saintly personage equally gracious,</p>
<p class="t0">It happened that not fifty paces below,</p>
<p class="t0">Behind a big boulder sat Little White Crow.</p>
<p class="t0">He was fishing for trout, and I wish I could catch,</p>
<p class="t0">In these days of saw-mills another such batch!</p>
<p class="t0">The rock, as I&rsquo;ve said, hid the priest from his view,</p>
<p class="t0">But he heard a great splash, and he saw a canoe</p>
<p class="t0">Float down bottom upwards, while close behind that</p>
<p class="t0">Swam jauntily after,&mdash;a big shovel hat.</p>
<p class="t0">No moment to ponder paused Little White Crow:</p>
<p class="t0">He sprang from the bank like a shaft from a bow;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p class="t0">He could swim like a mallard and dive like a loon,</p>
<p class="t0">But he reached the poor priest not a moment too soon;</p>
<p class="t0">Caught hold of his cassock and collared him fast,</p>
<p class="t0">Just while he was sinking the third time and last;</p>
<p class="t0">Then reaching the shore, dragged the poor Father out,</p>
<p class="t0">As you&rsquo;d land a remarkably overgrown trout!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It&rsquo;s needless to mention that Little White Crow</p>
<p class="t0">Did not know, and could not be expected to know,</p>
<p class="t0">Doctor Marshall Hall&rsquo;s method, so justly renowned,</p>
<p class="t0">For restoring to life the apparently drowned;</p>
<p class="t0">But he worked in his own way with such a good will,</p>
<p class="t0">He rubbed and he chafed with such zeal and such skill</p>
<p class="t0">That the priest after heaving some very deep sighs,</p>
<p class="t0">First yawned, and then groaned, and then opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="t0">Little Crow&rsquo;s simple means as completely succeeded,</p>
<p class="t0">As ever the treatment of any M.D. did.</p>

<p class="t0">He ceased, the red-skin gravely smiled,</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He grinned, and without any further delay</p>
<p class="t0">Put the tooth in his med&rsquo;cine bag safely away,</p>
<p class="t0">And then with a gesture more free than polite,</p>
<p class="t0">Clapped the priest on the shoulder and wished him, &ldquo;good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="t0">Before us next year&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve no time to moralize.</p>
<p class="t0">Well, a year and a day had elapsed as I&rsquo;ve stated,</p>

<p class="t0">Little White Crow and a score of his friends</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">They&rsquo;d been rather more lucky than usual, I think,</p>
<p class="t0">In hunting the beaver, the bear and the mink;</p>
<p class="t0">And their spoils at Quebec they intended to trade</p>
<p class="t0">For the goods of the French, which long habit had made</p>
<p class="t0">If not indispensable still very handy,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Knives, gunpowder, kettles, beads, bullets and brandy.</p>
<p class="t0">To keep to my story: our friends on this day</p>
<p class="t0">Down the river were calmly pursuing their way,</p>
<p class="t0">When Little White Crow in the foremost canoe</p>
<p class="t0">Was startled to hear a wild hullabaloo.</p>
<p class="t0">He sprang to his feet, and he shaded his eyes,</p>
<p class="t0">Then cried in a voice of alarm and surprise&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">(We all use strong words when things happen to plague us),</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh bother it! here are those bless&rsquo;d Onondagas!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">He said; and with yells of defiance the crews</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh! pleasant it is through the forest to stray</p>

<p class="t0">To list to the scream of the merry blue jay,</p>
<p class="t0">And the chirp of the squirrel so blithe and gay,</p>
<p class="t0">And the sigh of the soft south winds that play</p>
<p class="t0">In the top of the pine trees tall and grey</p>
<p class="t2">A sweet regretful tune.</p>

<p class="t0">When instead of the song of the frolicsome bird,</p>

<p class="t0">Little White Crow, at the close of the day,</p>
<p class="t0">With a handful of comrades was standing at bay;</p>
<p class="t0">Things had gone with them badly, they were but a score</p>
<p class="t0">And the enemy numbered a hundred or more.</p>
<p class="t0">Now flushed with success and of victory sure,</p>
<p class="t0">The Iroquois, thinking their triumph secure,</p>
<p class="t0">Were preparing to deal one last finishing blow</p>
<p class="t0">To annihilate utterly Little White Crow!</p>
<p class="t0">Poor Little White Crow! though a &ldquo;fisher of men,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">He hardly looked like an apostle just then;</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;d been dodging all day behind rock, bush and tree,</p>
<p class="t0">A cunning old fox in a scrimmage was he.</p>
<p class="t0">But numbers will tell in the long run, and now,</p>
<p class="t0">With hate in his heart and revenge on his brow,</p>
<p class="t0">With his knife in his teeth and his gun in his hand,</p>
<p class="t0">As he urged on his comrades to make one last stand,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p class="t0">Though his bullets were spent and their arrows all gone&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">He looked more like Old Nick, I&rsquo;m afraid, than Saint John!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Little White Crow had poured into his gun</p>
<p class="t0">His last charge of powder, but bullets he&rsquo;d none;</p>
<p class="t0">He searched in his shot pouch again and again,</p>
<p class="t0">He begged of his comrades, but begged all in vain;</p>
<p class="t0">Among the whole party in fact there was not</p>
<p class="t0">So much as one pellet of No. 6 shot.</p>
<p class="t0">He was just giving up the whole job in disgust</p>
<p class="t0">When his hand in his med&rsquo;cine bag chancing to thrust,</p>
<p class="t0">As Fortune would have it his fingers he ran</p>
<p class="t0">Against the back tooth of the blessed Saint Anne!</p>
<p class="t0">Little White Crow gave a terrible shout,</p>
<p class="t0">The tooth in a trice from the bag he whipped out,</p>
<p class="t0">Dropped it into his musket, and yelling still louder,</p>
<p class="t0">He rammed it well home on the top of the powder.</p>
<p class="t0">But here come the foe! From rocks, bushes and trees</p>
<p class="t0">They start like a swarm of exasperate bees;</p>
<p class="t0">A capital simile that is in any case,</p>
<p class="t0">To describe an assault of Oneidas or Senecas:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p class="t0">And one, as it happens, remarkably apt in</p>
<p class="t0">This particular case, for the Iroquois Captain</p>
<p class="t0">Was a chief called Big Hornet,&mdash;a beggar to fight,</p>
<p class="t0">Who measured six feet and some inches in height.</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twas he gave the signal to make the attack,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twas he led the rush of the bloodthirsty pack,</p>
<p class="t0">And &rsquo;twas he, as he charged in the front of the foe,</p>
<p class="t0">Attracted the notice of Little White Crow.</p>
<p class="t0">Little White Crow brought his gun to his shoulder,</p>
<p class="t0">And rested the barrel on top of a boulder,</p>
<p class="t0">Singled out the Big Hornet&rsquo;s conspicuous figure,</p>
<p class="t0">Drew a bead on his forehead,&mdash;and then pulled the trigger.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Click&rdquo; went the flint lock, and the musket went &ldquo;bang,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">The forest around with the loud echo rang,</p>
<p class="t0">The gun burst to atoms, so great was the shock,</p>
<p class="t0">And vanished entirely, lock, barrel and stock:</p>
<p class="t0">While wholly uninjured, incredible though,</p>
<p class="t0">It seems, I acknowledge, was Little White Crow.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But the Iroquois Chief gave a horrible yell,</p>
<p class="t0">He threw up his arms and then backward he fell;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p class="t0">He sprang to his feet and fell backward again,</p>
<p class="t0">He rolled, and he writhed, and he wriggled with pain.</p>
<p class="t0">His friends gathered round him and started aghast,</p>
<p class="t0">At seeing a <i>tooth</i> to his nose sticking fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Away,&rdquo; they cried, smitten with panic, &ldquo;away!</p>

<h4>Part III.</h4>

<p class="t0">In the Iroquois towns very deep was the grief,</p>

<p class="t0">There wasn&rsquo;t a woman in all the Five Nations,</p>
<p class="t0">Who didn&rsquo;t indulge in prolonged lamentations.</p>
<p class="t0">They tried to relieve him, but tried all in vain,</p>
<p class="t0">The tenderest touch produced exquisite pain:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p class="t0">The med&rsquo;cine men tried incantations and sorceries,</p>
<p class="t0">And yet, though their magic as strong as a hawser is,</p>

<p class="t0">The more they incanted the tighter it got.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A Dutchman from Albany came to their aid,</p>
<p class="t0">Who had once been a student of medicine at Leyden;</p>
<p class="t0">He practised in vain each resource of his trade,</p>
<p class="t0">And swore that the tooth by the foul fiend was made,</p>
<p class="t0">While its carious cavity was, so he said,</p>
<p class="t">A hole for the Devil to hide in.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Big Hornet meanwhile grew haggard and grey,</p>
<p class="t0">With grief and chagrin he was wasting away;</p>
<p class="t0">His friends found their efforts all powerless to save</p>
<p class="t0">Their chief in his rapid descent to the grave;</p>
<p class="t0">There was nobody able to set the tooth free,</p>
<p class="t0">It clung like a little Old Man of the Sea!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It happened one day there was brought to the town</p>
<p class="t0">A captive French priest in a shabby black gown;</p>
<p class="t0">He had very black eyes and a rather red nose,</p>
<p class="t0">Wore shoes with steel buckles, and very square toes;</p>
<p class="t0">He&rsquo;d a stoop in the shoulder, was yellow of skin,</p>
<p class="t0">And a week&rsquo;s growth of bristles disfigured his chin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p class="t0">Alas and alack! it was Father Le Cocq:</p>
<p class="t0">The Iroquois wolves had both harried the flock</p>
<p class="t0">And kidnapped the shepherd&mdash;now doomed to be fried as</p>
<p class="t0">Soon as it suited the heathen Oneidas!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now, just as a drowning man grabs at a straw,</p>
<p class="t0">His aid was besought by the favourite squaw</p>
<p class="t0">Of the sick man&mdash;no doubt at some saint&rsquo;s kind suggestion</p>
<p class="t0">To specify which is quite out of the question.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Frenchman, remove the excrescence that grows</p>
<p class="t0">So horribly tight on the bridge of his nose,</p>
<p class="t0">And home to your friends you shall safely return</p>

<p class="t0">Thus urged, the good Jesuit followed the squaw;</p>
<p class="t0">But oh! his bewilderment, wonder and awe,</p>
<p class="t">No tongue can describe, and no pencil can paint,</p>
<p class="t0">When lifting his hands in amazement he saw</p>
<p class="t">On the nose of the red-skin the tooth of the saint.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But Father Le Cocq wasn&rsquo;t long at a loss;</p>

<p class="t0">When, wondrous to hear and amazing to tell,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p class="t0">The tooth from the nose incontinent fell.</p>
<p class="t0">And the chief, from that moment, began to get well!</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My story is told. There&rsquo;s no more to relate.</p>
<p class="t0">The Iroquois sent back the Father in state;</p>

<p class="t0">Then gave him more furs than he knew how to carry,</p>

<p class="t0">He bore the back tooth of the blessed Saint Anne!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As for Little White Crow from that day to the end</p>
<p class="t0">Of his life he was known as the &ldquo;Frenchman&rsquo;s best friend&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="t0">A friend of French missions he called himself, and he</p>
<p class="t0">Without any doubt was a friend of French brandy.</p>
<p class="t0">At the close of a well spent career the old man had a</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
